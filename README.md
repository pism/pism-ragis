# pism-ragis: A Reanalysis for the Greenland Ice Sheet (RAGIS)

## Repository for work related to NASA ROSES award 80NSSC21K0748 (2021-24).

### Synopsis

The stability of the Greenland Ice Sheet in a warming climate is a critical societal concern. Predicting Greenland's contribution to sea level remains a challenge as historical simulations of the past decades show limited agreement with observations. In this project, we develop a data assimilation framework that combines sparse observations and the ice sheet model PISM to produce a reanalysis of the state of the Greenland Ice Sheet from 1980 to 2020 using probabilistic filtering methods.
